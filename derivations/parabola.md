# Parabola

## Axiom

The normal form of a saddle-node bifurcation is

$$\dot x \;=\; \mu - x^2,$$

with equilibria $x_\pm = \pm\sqrt{\mu}$ for $\mu \geq 0$ coalescing at
$\mu = 0$ and vanishing for $\mu < 0$.  By the saddle-node universality
theorem (Guckenheimer & Holmes, 1983), every local saddle-node
bifurcation in a smooth one-parameter family is smoothly conjugate to
this normal form near the bifurcation point.  The framework uses the
normal form directly; no additional model-specific structure is
introduced at saddle-nodes.

## Role

Two uses:

- **Tongue boundaries.** Each [Arnold tongue](arnold_tongue.md) of the
  [circle map](circle_map.md) is bounded by saddle-node bifurcations.
  The universal $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ scaling of the distance to the
  tongue edge gives the basin measure $P \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$,
  which under amplitude–probability identification becomes the
  exponent 2 in the [Born rule](born_rule.md).

- **Criticality geometry.** The $x^2$ curvature at the saddle-node
  fixes the local escape rate and the dominant timescale near
  criticality; this supplies the ratio $\tau \cdot \Delta\theta = 1$
  used in the [uncertainty-like relation](uncertainty.md).

The parabola is the only primitive with a differential character; the
other three primitives are combinatorial.
